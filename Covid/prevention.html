      <h1>Let's try not to show the symptoms of this deadly <br> virus and try to keep ourselves safe.Our behaviour <br> determines the good health for the world.</h1>
      <h2>The following key measures can be effective in  <br> case of being safe from Corona Virus(COVID-19).</h2>


    </div>
    <div class="middle">
      <h3>1.Wash your hands frequently and carefully </h3> <br>

      <p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, <br> between your  fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap. <br> <br>  Use hand sanitizer when  you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, <br> especially after touching anything, <br> including your phone or laptop. </p> <br>

      <h3>2.Avoid touching your face </h3> <br>

      <p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like:
      <ul>
        <li>gas pump handle</li>
        <li>your cell phone</li>
        <li>a doorknob</li>
      </ul>




Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. <br> This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.
</p> <br>

      <h3>3.Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now </h3> <br>

      <p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.</p> <br>
        <img class="two" src="images/two.png" alt="">

      <h3>4.Don’t share personal items </h3> <br>

      Happens to be:
      <ul>
        <li>Phone</li>
        <li>Makeup</li>
        <li>Comb</li>
      </ul>


It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and <br> other dishes for their own use only.</p> <br>

      <h3>5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h3> <br>

      <p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people <br> when you cough, sneeze, or talk. <br> <br> It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.

Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as <br> clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.</p> <br>

      <h3>6. Clean and disinfect surfaces </h3> <br>

      <p>Use alcohol-based disinfectants to clean hard surfaces in your home like:
        <ul>
          <li>Countertops</li>
          <li>Door Handles</li>
          <li>Furniture</li>
          <li>Toys</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

   <p> Also, clean your phone, laptop, and anything else you use regularly several times a day.

Disinfect areas after you bring groceries <br> or packages into your home.

Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting surfaces.
</p> <br>

      <h3>7. Take physical (social) distancing seriously</h3> <br>

      <p>If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if you don’t <br>  have symptoms.

Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when possible. <br> <br>

If you must go out for  necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone  <br> in close contact to you.
</p> <br>

      <h3>8.Do not gather in a group </h3> <br>
      <img class="point" src="images/point.jpg" alt="">

      <p>Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you’ll be in close contact with someone.

This includes avoiding all relather in <br> groupsigious places of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also includes not congregating at <br> parks or beaches.
</p> <br>

      <h3>9. Avoid eating or drinking in public places</h3> <br>

      <p>Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other eateries.

The virus can be transmitted <br> through food, utensils, dishes, and cups. It may also be temporarily airborne from other people in the venue. <br> <br>

You can still get delivery or takeaway food. Choose foods that are thoroughly cooked and can be reheated.

High heat (at least 132°F/56°C, <br> according to one recent, not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill coronaviruses.

This means it may be best to avoid cold foods from <br> restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad bars. </p> <br>

      <h3>10.Wash fresh groceries </h3> <br>

      <p>Wash all produce under running water before eating or preparing.

The CDCTrusted Source and the FDATrusted Source do not recommend <br> using soap, detergent, or commercial produce wash on things like fruits and vegetables. Be sure to wash hands before and after handling these items.</p> <br>

      <h3>11. Wear a (homemade) mask</h3> <br>

      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendsTrusted Source that almost everyone wears a cloth face mask in public settings <br> where physical distancing may be difficult, such as grocery stores. <br> <br>

When used correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomatic or  undiagnosed from transmitting SARS-CoV-2 when they breathe, <br> talk, sneeze, or cough. This, in turn, slows the transmission of the virus.</p> <br><br>

<p>Some points to keep in mind:
<ul class="points">
  <li>Wearing a mask alone will not prevent you from getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Careful handwashing and physical distancing must also be followed.</li>
  <li>Cloth masks aren’t as effective as other types of masks, such as surgical masks or N95 respirators. However, these other masks should be reserved for <br> healthcare workers and first responders.</li>
  <li>Wash your hands before you put on your mask.</li>
  <li>Wash your mask after each use.</li>
  <li>You can transfer the virus from your hands to the mask. If you’re wearing a mask, avoid touching the front of it.</li>
  <li>You can also transfer the virus from the mask to your hands. Wash your hands if you touch the front of the mask.</li>
  <li>A mask shouldn’t be worn by a child under 2 years old, a person who has trouble breathing, or a person who can’t remove the mask on their own.</li>
</ul>
